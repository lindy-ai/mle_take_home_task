# data set

The data set is generated by the players of a game. The data itself is in compressed CSV format split in multiple files. We have two datasets ```data/profiles``` and ```data/activity``` in their distinct folders. Data does not have a header row. The ```profiles``` dataset contains user profiles with following columns:

* player_id (integer) - unique identifier of the player
* registration_date (yyyy-MM-dd) - date when the player 1st played the game
* country code (integer) - country of the user
* operating system (integer) - operating system of the user
* device type (integer) - type of device used by the player

The ```activity``` contains the information on players' daily visits in the game. E.g. if player with ID ```123``` plays the game at least once on ```2018-09-02``` then there is a row with those values in the data set.
Complete schema of ```activity``` dataset contains columns:

* event_date (yyyy-MM-dd) 
* player_id (integer) - unique identifier of the player
* money_spent (float) - Total money spent during the day
* session_count (integer) - Number of game sessions for the day
* purchase_count (integer) - Number of purchases during the day
* time_spent_seconds (integer) - Total time spent playing during the day
* ads_impressions (integer) - Total number of seen ads during the day
* ads_clicks (integer) - Total number of clicked ads during the day
